A cross-sectional study was conducted on postpartum women who returned to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic for routine examination from January 2016 to September 2017. A total of 344 women received assessments based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). An EPDS score of ≥10 indicated the presence of postpartum depressive symptoms (PPDS). A total of 97 women without such symptoms and 23 with PPDS completed nutritional parameter analyses and questionnaires. The results showed that the prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) was 8.4%. The proportion was 70% for those who practiced confinement at home, significantly higher than for those in the non-PPDS group (45%). The overall psychological stress score was significantly higher and the postpartum care satisfaction score was significantly lower in those with PPDS compared to those without. In terms of nutritional biomarkers, the plasma riboflavin levels in the PPDS group were significantly lower than those in their symptomless counterparts (13.9%). The vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency rates in the non-PPD and PPDS groups were 35%, 41%, 48%, 26%, respectively. However, compared with those in the non-PPDS group, those with PPDS had significantly higher ratios of Σn-6/Σn-3, C20:3n-6/C18:3n-6, and C20:4n-6/(C20:5n-3 + C22:6n-3) (by 8.2%, 79.7%, and 8.8%, respectively), whereas they had lower ratios of C22:6n-3/C22:5n-6 (by 15.5%). Higher plasma riboflavin and erythrocyte C16:1n-9, C24:1n-9, C18:3n-6, and C20:5n-3 levels and lower Σn-6 fatty acid and C22:5n-6 levels decreased the risk of PPD after type of confinement, overall mental stress scores, and postpartum care satisfaction scores were adjusted for the logistic regression analysis.

      "----\n",
      "[\"Food insecurity is a global concern. While it was once characterized mainly as a problem of undernutrition, it is now recognized that a person may be food insecure without experiencing hunger. Numerous studies have demonstrated that food insecurity is strongly related to poor mental health around the world, but the mechanisms that underpin that relationship remain poorly understood. One body of research from nutritional sciences posits that nutrient deficiency impacts brain function, producing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Another body of research from the social sciences posits that the social consequences of having to eat non-preferred foods or obtain food in socially unacceptable ways may compromise mental health through stress. This study was designed to clarify the mechanisms linking food insecurity and mental health using case studies in rural Brazil and urban Ethiopia. Working with samples consisting of about 200 adult household decision-makers (mostly female) recruited between 2015 and 2019\\xa0at each site, we tested for nutritional and social mediation of the food insecurity-mental health relationship using multivariable linear regression and mediation analysis. Our analyses found no evidence of mediation in either setting. Moreover, there was no association between nutritional status variables and food insecurity. These findings suggest that food insecurity likely impacts mental health directly through forms of basic needs deprivation, such as worrying about where one's next meal will come from, rather than by acting as a social signal or even by impacting nutritional status. These results underscore the power of basic-needs deprivation for impacting mental health.\"]\n",

Relative to controls, those in the experimental condition reported higher positive affect after the mindfulness induction, which in turn reduced their energy intake.

      "['Lumateperone (Caplyta<sup>®</sup>) is a drug recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of schizophrenia. But is it a new drug with promise, or a similar drug with new wrappings? This drug, similar to other second- and third-generation serotonin dopamine antagonists, is a potent antagonist at higher serotonin 2A receptors as well as brief binding to dopamine 1 and dopamine 2 (D2) receptors, but also has partial agonism at presynaptic D2 and indirect modulation of N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) of the glutamine receptors. The current article reviews the putative effects of this novel mechanism of action on symptoms of schizophrenia as discussed in Phase II and III trials. A case study applies the information to a clinical situation. [Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services, 58(6), 9-12.].']\n",

      "['Traumatic Spinal Cord Injuries (TSCI) have a disastrous effect on the physical and mental health of both the patients and their relatives. Around 15 % of these injuries are caused by burst fractures, a sub-type of compressive fractures of the vertebral body. The transient dynamics of these fracture have been studied through in vitro experiments coupled with numerical simulations, but no direct observation have ever been made of their genesis and evolution and the behaviour of the nucleus pulposus under compressive loading has only been hypothesized. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interactions between the vertebral body and the nucleus pulposus under dynamic compressive loading using high-speed cineradiography. A radiopaque agent was injected into the nuclei pulposi of 4 young porcine thoraco-lumbar and lumbar cadaveric segments, and a dynamic compressive load was applied to them using a servo-hydraulic bench-test. The compression process was filmed with a custom high-speed fluoroscope. The nucleus pulposus loaded the vertebral endplate up to 14,142 ± 486 N, before fracturing it and diffusing into the vertebral body. Then, internal pressure seemingly built up until an outward projection of the nucleus pulposus, at an antero-posterior velocity up to 2.9 m.s<sup>-1</sup>, or until retroprojection of bony fragments into the spinal canal. These results directly corroborate the hypotheses previously made by other studies and stress the unprecedented advantages of using high-speed cineradiography for the study of complex fractures genesis and evolution.Clinical Relevance- Methodology and results from this study would provide an unprecedented insight on the genesis and transient evolution of complex spinal fractures.']\n",

A purposive sample of 13 patients who underwent APCS transplantation to treat progressive infectious keratitis were enrolled in the semi-structured, open-ended interviews. The taped and transcribed interviews were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Alterations in the transparency of APCS grafts were accompanied by a gradual improved visual acuity (before surgery: 1.38± 0.91 logMAR; 3mo postoperatively: 0.40±0.24 logMAR, respectively). Accordingly, in terms of lived experiences, the patients generally reported \"negative\" experiences before the operation and during the early postoperative period, but this was greatly improved 3mo after surgery. Four main themes were derived: anxiety and fear, stigma, lifestyle change, and gratitude and insights. Conclusively, health care professionals should provide holistic care for patients, proactively promoting patients\\' physical and mental health.']\n",
