      "Sentence 22760\n",
      "This trial demonstrated that concomitant infusions of amino acid can prevent acivicin-induced CNS toxicity, which allows the dose of acivicin to be escalated 2-fold above previously tolerable doses; however, this effect did not translate in a significant increment in acivicin Css.\n",
      "Sentence 22761\n",
      "In China, combination of herb Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge) and Honghua (Carthamus tinctorius L.) is effective for stroke treatment in patients but its underlying mechanism requires further investigation.\n",

      "With such methods as neurological deficits scoring, TTC, HE and TUNEL staining, and ELISA detection, the results demonstrated that administration of either Danshensu or HSYA improved neurological defects and alleviated pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress reactions.\n",
      "Sentence 22764\n",
      "Taken together, we found for the first time that Danshensu plus HSYA could achieve remarkable synergistic neuroprotective effects on I/R injury, which is related to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways.\n",
