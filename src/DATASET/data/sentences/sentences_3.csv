32697259,"Here, we found that FTEs supplementation effectively alleviated the body weight gain, visceral fat accumulation, dyslipidemia, and impaired glucose tolerance induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from FTEs-treated mice showed similar protective effects as FTEs supplementation in mice fed with a HFD."
32697259,"In particular, FTEs reversed HFD-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis via increasing the relative abundances of Bacteroides, Adlercreutzia, Alistipes, Parabacteroides, and norank_f_Lachnospiraceae, and reducing that of Staphylococcus."
32697259,"Interestingly, FTEs could still alleviate HFD-induced lipid accumulation in mice treated with antibiotics, which had increased relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Bacteroides, and Bacteroides_uniformis sp. In addition, supplementation with FTEs also modified the serum metabolome, especially the ""caffeine metabolism"" pathway."
32697259,"Overall, FTEs exerts beneficial effects against obesity induced by HFD, and the underlying mechanism is partially related to the reprogramming of intestinal microbiota, while the metabolism of caffeine in FTEs also played an important role in the process."

26220941,Abnormal dopamine neurotransmission is associated with many different genetic and acquired dystonic disorders.
26220941,"For instance, mutations in genes critical for the synthesis of dopamine, including GCH1 and TH cause l-DOPA-responsive dystonia."
26220941,"Despite evidence that implicates abnormal dopamine neurotransmission in dystonia, the precise nature of the pre- and postsynaptic defects that result in dystonia are not known."
26220941,"To better understand these defects, we generated a knock-in mouse model of l-DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD) mice that recapitulates the human p.381Q>K TH mutation (c.1141C>A)."
26220941,"Mice homozygous for this mutation displayed the core features of the human disorder, including reduced TH activity, dystonia that worsened throughout the course of the active phase, and improvement in the dystonia in response to both l-DOPA and trihexyphenidyl."
26220941,Microinjection of l-DOPA directly into the striatum ameliorated the dystonic movements but cerebellar microinjections of l-DOPA had no effect.
26220941,"Surprisingly, the striatal dopamine concentration was reduced to ∼1% of normal, a concentration more typically associated with akinesia, suggesting that (mal)adaptive postsynaptic responses may also play a role in the development of dystonia."
26220941,"Administration of D1- or D2-like dopamine receptor agonists to enhance dopamine signalling reduced the dystonic movements, whereas administration of D1- or D2-like dopamine receptor antagonists to further reduce dopamine signalling worsened the dystonia, suggesting that both receptors mediate the abnormal movements."
26220941,"Further, D1-dopamine receptors were supersensitive; adenylate cyclase activity, locomotor activity and stereotypy were exaggerated in DRD mice in response to the D1-dopamine receptor agonist SKF 81297."
26220941,D2-dopamine receptors exhibited a change in the valence in DRD mice with an increase in adenylate cyclase activity and blunted behavioural responses after challenge with the D2-dopamine receptor agonist quinpirole.

The AhR interacts with several cell signaling pathways associated with induction of tyrosine kinases, cytokines and growth factors which may support the survival roles of AhR escaping from apoptosis elicited by a variety of apoptosis inducing agents in breast cancer."
25987214,"Activation of AhR by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in AhR overexpressing breast cancer cells effectively suppressed the apoptotic response induced by UV-irradiation, doxorubicin, lapatinib and paclitaxel."
25987214,"The anti-apoptotic response of TCDD was uniformly antagonized by the treatment with 3'methoxy-4'nitroflavone (MNF), a specific antagonist of AhR. TCDD's survival action of apoptosis was accompanied with the induction of well-known inflammatory genes, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and NF-κB subunit RelB. Moreover, TCDD increased the activity of the immunosuppressive enzyme indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO), which metabolizes tryptophan to kynurenine (Kyn) and mediates tumor immunity."

26030405,"Our data indicated that repeated VPA treatment attenuated MA-induced hyperlocomotor, and the effect was associated with decreased levels of phosphorylated GSK3β at Ser 9 in the NAcC. Moreover, repeated bilateral intra-NAcC, but not intra-NAcSh VPA treatment, significantly attenuated MA-induced hyperactivity."
26030405,Our results suggested that GSK3β activity in NAcC contributes to the inhibitory effects of VPA on MA-induced hyperactivity.

3964838,Insulin-induced hypoglycemia in normothermic rats caused progressive neurological depression and differentially altered regional cerebral acetylcholine metabolism.
3964838,"Reductions of plasma glucose from 7.7 mM (control) to 2.5-1.7 mM (moderate hypoglycemia associated with decreased motor activity) or 1.5 mM (severe hypoglycemia with lethargy progressing to stupor) decreased glucose concentrations in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus to less than 10% of control."
3964838,"Moderate hypoglycemia diminished acetylcholine concentrations in cortex and striatum (21% and 45%, respectively) and reduced [1-2H2, 2-2H2]choline incorporation into acetylcholine (62% and 41%, respectively)."
3964838,Severe hypoglycemia did not reduce the acetylcholine concentration or synthesis in cortex and striatum further.
3964838,"The concentrations of choline rose in the cortex (+53%) and striatum (+130%) of animals that became stuporous but a similar rise in [1-2H2, 2-2H2]choline left the specific activities of choline in these structures unchanged."
3964838,"In rats that developed hypoglycemic stupor and were then treated with glucose, the animals recovered apparently normal behavior, and the concentrations of acetylcholine and the incorporation of [1-2H2, 2-2H2]-choline into acetylcholine returned to control values in the striatum but not in the cerebral cortex."
3964838,"Thus, impaired acetylcholine metabolism in selected regions of the brain may contribute to the early symptoms of neurological dysfunction in hypoglycemia."
7463059,"During insulin stupor in mice, acetylcholine levels in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, striatum, and hippocampus were unchanged from control values despite brain glucose concentrations 3-10% of normal, whereas choline levels rose 2.4-3.6-fold in all five CNS regions."
7463059,"The data suggest that, in hypoglycemic stupor, (1) overall rates of acetylcholine synthesis and degradation remain balanced within each of the CNS regions studied; (2) the biochemical mechanism that elevates brain choline levels is unlikely to be related only to cholinergic synaptic processes; and (3) brain choline levels need not rise for stupor to occur."
26404241,"We performed a review in order to evaluate the extant evidence regarding: (1) the association between intake and serum levels of tocopherols and tocotrienols and age-related pathologies (osteoporosis, sarcopenia and cognitive impairment); and (2) the optimum diet therapy or supplementation with tocopherols and tocotrienols for the treatment of these abnormalities."
26404241,"The recent literature underlines that, given the detrimental effect of low intake and serum levels of tocopherols and tocotrienols on bone, muscle mass, and cognitive function, a change in the lifestyle must be the cornerstone in the prevention of these specific age-related pathologies related to vitamin E-deficient status."
26404241,"These goals must be reached through: accession of the elderly subjects to specific personalized dietary programs aimed at achieving and/or maintaining body weight (avoid malnutrition); increase their intake of food rich in vitamin E, such as derivatives of oily seeds (in particular wheat germ oil), olive oil, hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds, and cereals rich in vitamin E (such as specific rice cultivar rich in tocotrienols) or take vitamin E supplements."
29019353,"Central to this success was the idea that to achieve best disease outcomes and minimize the development of drug resistance, at least three antiretroviral agents should be used for HIV treatment."
29019353,"This therapeutic strategy is a core tenet of HIV medicine, backed by incontrovertible scientific evidence, and made easy to deploy by the high compliance levels with once-daily coformulations, which have generally been well tolerated."
29019353,"Crucially, no drug resistance mutations were seen in study participants who remained on their regimen."
29019353,"While the idea of a two-drug regimen has been entertained for maintenance therapy, there may be little willingness to push this further into the area of antiretroviral treatment initiation, for the justifiable concerns that exist around the emergence of drug resistance."
29019353,"The regimen was well tolerated, with no reported drug resistance mutations while on treatment."
29019353,"There are many real-world advantages to a two-drug regimen approach, among them lower costs (crucial in resource-limited settings where affordability may be a limiting factor), fewer adverse effects or drug toxicities, and possibly improved compliance."

10074240,This research was to observe the effects of lithium chloride (LiCl) and Harringtonine (HT) on the proliferation and differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells.
10074240,"The results obtained by liquid suspension culture, semi-solid colony culture and 3H-TdR incorporation into HL-60 cells indicated that different concentrations of LiCl (5-20 mmol/L) and HT (10(-8)-10(-5)mol/L) exerted the inhibitory effects in a dose-dependent manner on HL-60 cell proliferation respectively."
10074240,"When LiCl (10 mmol/L) and HT (10(-7) mol/L) were added together in the liquid culture or semi-solid culture of HL-60 cells, they showed much greater inhibitory effect than that by each agent separately."
10074240,It was discovered that there was induction of the differentiation of HL-60 cells by lithium and HT and the induction of HL-60 cells differentiation by HT was markedly enhanced by the addition of low concentration of lithium.
10074240,"This work also showed that by treating HL-60 cells with lithium and HT, the expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene was markedly decreased as measured by RT/PCR-mRNA (P < 0.01)."

25255070,"Buprenorphine and carprofen, 2 of the most commonly used analgesics in mice, must be administered every 8 to 12 h to provide sustained analgesia."
25255070,"Bup-SR provided plasma drug levels greater than the therapeutic level for the first 24 to 48 h after administration, but plasma levels of Bup-HCl fell below the therapeutic level by 4 h. Fent-SR maintained plasma levels greater than reported therapeutic levels for 12 h. Therapeutic levels of the remaining drugs are unknown, but Carp-SR provided plasma drug levels similar to those of Carp for the first 24 h after administration, whereas Melox-SR had greater plasma levels than did Melox for the first 8 h. Butp-SR provided detectable plasma drug levels for the first 24 h, with a dramatic decrease over the first 4 h. These results indicate that Bup-SR provides a stable plasma drug level adequate for analgesia for 24 to 48 h after administration, whereas Carp-SR, Melox-SR, Fent-SR, and Butp-SR would require additional doses to provide analgesic plasma levels beyond 24 h in mice."

27713506,The increased β-catenin expression promotes sphere cell formation and expression of stemness markers and this β-catenin-induced stemness is responsible for PAK1-mediated cisplatin resistance.
27713506,We enrolled 87 NSCLC patients who had received cisplatin-based chemotherapy to confirm the association between PAK1 expression and response to chemotherapy and outcomes.

21592674,We had felt that clostridia in the gut might be involved in autism because they are virulent organisms and spore-formers; spores would resist antibacterial agents so that when antibiotics were discontinued the spores would germinate and by toxin production or another mechanism lead to autism.
21592674,Desulfovibrio is an anaerobic bacillus that does not produce spores but is nevertheless resistant to aerobic and other adverse conditions by other mechanisms and is commonly resistant to certain antimicrobial agents (such as cephalosporins) often used to treat ear and other infections that are relatively common in childhood.
21592674,This bacterium also produces important virulence factors and its physiology and metabolism position it uniquely to account for much of the pathophysiology seen in autism.
17904761,"This manuscript reviews evidence indicating that intestinal bacteria, specifically clostridia, may play a role in certain cases of autism and hypothesizes that the clostridial spores (which are notably resistant to antimicrobial agents and commonly used germicides) are involved in: (1) relapse in the autistic subject after a response to an agent such as oral vancomycin, after the drug is discontinued, (2) the unexplained increased incidence of autism in recent years, and (3) the unexplained increase in numbers of multiple cases in the same family."

35573737,"Ribosomes translating inner-membrane proteins are recognized and targeted to the translocon with the help of the signal recognition particle, SRP, and SRP receptor, FtsY. The growing nascent peptide is then inserted into the phospholipid bilayer at the translocon, an inner-membrane protein complex consisting of SecY, SecE, and SecG. Folding of membrane proteins requires that transmembrane helices (TMs) attain their correct topology, the soluble domains are inserted at the correct (cytoplasmic or periplasmic) side of the membrane, and - for polytopic membrane proteins - the TMs find their interaction partner TMs in the phospholipid bilayer."
35573737,"We describe how spontaneous fluctuations of the translocon allow diffusion of TMs into the phospholipid bilayer and argue that the ribosome orchestrates cotranslational targeting not only by providing the binding platform for the RPBs or the translocon, but also by helping the nascent chains to find their correct orientation in the membrane."

24442097,"Scarce evidence suggests that inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation predicts poor response to antidepressants, which could result in worse depression outcome."
24442097,This study prospectively examined whether inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation predicted the 2-year course of depressive disorders among antidepressant users.
24442097,"Data were from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, including 315 persons (18-65 years) with a current depressive disorder (major depressive disorder, dysthymia) at baseline according to the DSM-IV criteria and using antidepressants."
24442097,"Elevated IL-6, low HDL cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperglycemia were associated with chronicity of depression in antidepressant users."

32892962,Autoantibodies which interfere with the function of the folate receptor alpha called folate receptor alpha autoantibodies have been identified in 58%-76% of children with ASD and independent studies have demonstrated that blood titers of these autoantibodies correlate with folate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid.
32892962,"Most significantly, case-series, open-label, and single and double-blind placebo-controlled studies suggest that d,l-leucovorin, a reduced folate that can bypass the blockage at the folate receptor alpha by using the reduced folate carrier, an alternate pathway, can substantially improve particular symptoms in children with ASD, especially those positive for folate receptor alpha autoantibodies."
28770615,Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been linked to abnormalities in folate metabolism.
28770615,Polymorphisms in folate genes may act in complex polygenic ways to increase the risk of developing ASD.
28770615,Autoantibodies that block folate transport into the brain have been associated with ASD and children with ASD and these autoantibodies respond to high doses of a reduced form of folate known as folinic acid (leucovorin calcium).
28770615,Some of the same abnormalities are also found in mothers of children with ASD and supplementing folate during preconception and gestational periods reduces the risk to the offspring from developing ASD.
28770615,These data suggest that folate pathway abnormalities may be a major metabolic disturbance underlying ASD that can be leveraged as biomarkers to improve symptoms and prevent ASD.

29167401,"Previous work, using models of acute nociceptive pain, indicated that analgesia by acetaminophen involves an indirect activation of CB1 receptors by the acetaminophen metabolite and endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitor AM 404."
29167401,"However, the contribution of the cannabinoid system to antihyperalgesia against inflammatory pain, the main indication of acetaminophen, and the precise site of the relevant CB1 receptors have remained elusive."
29167401,"Here, we analyzed acetaminophen analgesia in mice of either sex with inflammatory pain and found that acetaminophen exerted a dose-dependent antihyperalgesic action, which was mimicked by intrathecally injected AM 404."
29167401,"Consistent with a mechanism downstream of proinflammatory prostaglandin formation, acetaminophen also reversed hyperalgesia induced by intrathecal prostaglandin E2 To distinguish between a peripheral/spinal and a supraspinal action, we administered acetaminophen and AM 404 to hoxB8-CB1-/- mice, which lack CB1 receptors from the peripheral nervous system and the spinal cord."
29167401,"Accordingly, local injection of the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant into the rostral ventromedial medulla blocked acetaminophen-induced antihyperalgesia, while local rostral ventromedial medulla injection of AM 404 reduced hyperalgesia in wild-type mice but not in CB1-/- mice."
29167401,"Our results indicate that the cannabinoid system contributes not only to acetaminophen analgesia against acute pain but also against inflammatory pain, and suggest that the relevant CB1 receptors reside in the rostral ventromedial medulla."
29167401,Our present data indicate that enhanced cannabinoid signaling is also responsible for the analgesic effects of acetaminophen against inflammatory pain.
29167401,Local injections of the acetaminophen metabolite AM 404 and of cannabinoid receptor antagonists as well as data from tissue-specific CB1 receptor-deficient mice suggest the rostral ventromedial medulla as an important site of the cannabinoid-mediated analgesia by acetaminophen.
