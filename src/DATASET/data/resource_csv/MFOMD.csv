Bipolar disorder is defined by the presence of one or more episodes of abnormally elevated energy levels, cognition, and mood with or without one or more depressive episodes.

At the lower levels of mania, such as hypomania, individuals may appear energetic and excitable. At a higher level, individuals may behave erratically and impulsively, often making poor decisions due to unrealistic ideas about the future, and may have great difficulty with sleep. At the highest level, individuals can show psychotic behavior, including violence. Individuals who experience manic episodes also commonly experience depressive episodes, or symptoms, or a mixed state in which features of both mania and depression are present at the same time. These events are usually separated by periods of ""normal"" mood; but, in some individuals, depression and mania may rapidly alternate, which is known as rapid cycling. Severe manic episodes can sometimes lead to such psychotic symptoms as delusions and hallucinations.

The lifetime prevalence of all types of bipolar disorder is thought to be about 4% (meaning that about 4% of people experience some of the characteristic symptoms at some point in their life). Prevalence is similar in men and women and, broadly, across different cultures and ethnic groups. Genetic factors contribute substantially to the likelihood of developing bipolar disorder, and environmental factors are also implicated. Bipolar disorder is often treated with mood stabilizing medications and psychotherapy. In serious cases, in which there is a risk of harm to oneself or others, involuntary commitment may be used. These cases generally involve severe manic episodes with dangerous behavior or depressive episodes with suicidal ideation. There are widespread problems with social stigma, stereotypes, and prejudice against individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder exhibiting psychotic symptoms can sometimes be misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia.

Bipolar disorder is defined by the presence of one or more episodes of abnormally elevated energy levels, cognition, and mood with or without one or more depressive episodes.

At the lower levels of mania, such as hypomania, individuals may appear energetic and excitable. At a higher level, individuals may behave erratically and impulsively, often making poor decisions due to unrealistic ideas about the future, and may have great difficulty with sleep. At the highest level, individuals can show psychotic behavior, including violence. Individuals who experience manic episodes also commonly experience depressive episodes, or symptoms, or a mixed state in which features of both mania and depression are present at the same time. These events are usually separated by periods of ""normal"" mood; but, in some individuals, depression and mania may rapidly alternate, which is known as rapid cycling. Severe manic episodes can sometimes lead to such psychotic symptoms as delusions and hallucinations.

The lifetime prevalence of all types of bipolar disorder is thought to be about 4% (meaning that about 4% of people experience some of the characteristic symptoms at some point in their life). Prevalence is similar in men and women and, broadly, across different cultures and ethnic groups. Genetic factors contribute substantially to the likelihood of developing bipolar disorder, and environmental factors are also implicated. Bipolar disorder is often treated with mood stabilizing medications and psychotherapy. In serious cases, in which there is a risk of harm to oneself or others, involuntary commitment may be used. These cases generally involve severe manic episodes with dangerous behavior or depressive episodes with suicidal ideation. There are widespread problems with social stigma, stereotypes, and prejudice against individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder exhibiting psychotic symptoms can sometimes be misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia.

Exposure to the stimulus nearly always produces intense anxiety or a panic attack. Specific phobias are about twice as prevalent in women as in men and are rearely incapacitating. 

The degree to which they interfere with daily life depends on how easy is to avoid the feared object or situation. The phobias often begin during childhood.

Is plausible that phobias may result from an interaction of biological, cognitive, and environmental factors.

According to the psychodynamic viewpoint, phobias are expressions of wishes, fears and fantasies that are unacceptable to the patient. these unconscious conflicts are displaced (or shifted) from their original internal source to an external object or situation; the person blocks from consciousness the real source of anxiety and is able to avoid the dangerous impulse that the phobia represents.


DSM-IV-TR divides specific phobias into five types:

1.- Animal (such as spiders or snakes)
2.- Natural environmental ( such as earthquakes, thunder, water)
3.- Blood/injections or injury; individuals with this type of phobia, as opposed to other phobias, are likely to have a history of fainting in the phobic situation.
4.- Situational (includes fear of traveling in cars, planes, and elevators and fear of heights, tunnels, and bridges)
5.- Other (phobic avoidance of situations that may lead to choking, vomiting, or contracting an illness)

- Excessive or irrational fear of a specific object or situation.

- Avoiding the object or situation or enduring it with great distress.

- Physical symptoms of anxiety or a panic attack, such as a pounding heart, nausea or diarrhea, sweating, trembling or shaking, numbness or tingling, problems with breathing (shortness of breath), feeling dizzy or lightheaded, feeling like you are choking.

- Anticipatory anxiety, which involves becoming nervous ahead of time about being in certain situations or coming into contact with the object of your phobia. (For example, a person with a fear of dogs may become anxious about going for a walk because he or she may see a dog along the way.)

Children with a specific phobia may express their anxiety by crying, clinging to a parent, or throwing a tantrum.

A pathological mental process is a pathological process caused by a mental disease. 

A mental disorder is a physical disorder, for example, dysfunctional neurotransmitter receptors, altered brain connectivity, missing or damaged brain parts etc.  The disorder is the material basis for the disease and it is by virtue of the disorder that the disease causes the pathological processes that form part of the disease course. 

A diagnosis of a mental disease is a clinician's statement that a patient has a mental disease by virtue of observable manifestations of that disease, such as behaviour, observable aspects of the underlying disorder, or self-reported experiences.

DSM-IV-TR (american Psychiatric Association)|
People with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are dangerously thin. The process of eating becomes an obsession to them. Unusual eating habits develop, such as avoiding what they perceive as high caloric food and meals, picking out a few foods and eating only these in small quantities, or carefully weighing and portioning food.

People with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are dangerously thin. The process of eating becomes an obsession to them. Unusual eating habits develop, such as avoiding what they perceive as high caloric food and meals, picking out a few foods and eating only these in small quantities, or carefully weighing and portioning food. 

People with anorexia may repeatedly check their body weight and many engage in other techniques to control their weight, such as intense and compulsive exercise or purging by means of vomiting and abuse of laxatives, enemas, and diuretics.

Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay. Clear examples of boundaries of processes are almost always of the fiat sort (midnight, a time of death as declared in an operating theater or on a death certificate, the initiation of a state of war)",,,"a process of cell-division,  a beating of the heart|a process of sleeping|the course of a disease|the life of an organism|your process of aging.|a process of meiosis|the flight of a bird",,,,,(iff (Process a) (and (Occurrent a) (exists (b) (properTemporalPartOf b a)) (exists (c t) (and (MaterialEntity c) (specificallyDependsOnAt a c t))))) // axiom label in BFO2 CLIF: [083-003] ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BFO:0000015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo.owl,process,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_1094,attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,ADHD|attention deficit disorder|hyperkinetic disorder,"Mental disease that causes difficulties in concentrating and performing tasks, particularly in children.|A specific developmental disorder that is characterized by co-existence of attentional problems and hyperactivity, with each behavior occurring infrequently alone"" and symptoms starting before seven years of age.|Xref MGI.|Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric and a neurobehavioral disorder. It is characterized by either significant difficulties of inattention or hyperactivity and impulsiveness or a combination of the two. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), symptoms emerge before seven years of age. There are three subtypes of the disorder which consist of it being predominantly inattentive (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I), predominately hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-HI or ADHD-H), or the two combined (ADHD-C). Oftentimes people refer to ADHD-PI as ""Attention deficit disorder"" (ADD), however, the term was revised in the 1994 version of the DSM.

ADHD impacts school-aged children and results in restlessness, acting impulsively, and lack of focus which impairs their ability to learn properly. It is the most commonly studied and diagnosed psychiatric disorder in children, affecting about 3 to 5 percent of children globally and diagnosed in about 2 to 16 percent of school-aged children. It is a chronic disorder with 30 to 50 percent of those individuals diagnosed in childhood continuing to have symptoms into adulthood. Adolescents and adults with ADHD tend to develop coping mechanisms to compensate for some or all of their impairments. It is estimated that 4.7 percent of American adults live with ADHD. Standardized rating scales such as the World Health Organization's Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale can be used for ADHD screening and assessment of the disorder's symptoms' severity.

ADHD is diagnosed two to four times more frequently in boys than in girls, though studies suggest this discrepancy may be partially due to subjective bias of referring teachers. ADHD management usually involves some combination of medications, applied behavior analysis (ABA, previously known as behavior modification), lifestyle changes, and counseling. Its symptoms can be difficult to differentiate from other disorders, increasing the likelihood that the diagnosis of ADHD will be missed. In addition, most clinicians have not received formal training in the assessment and treatment of ADHD, in particular in adult patients.

[Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder]|The onset criterion on this disorder has been changed from “symptoms that caused impairment were present before age 7 years” to “several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age 12”.

A speed process profile, for example, is represented by a graph plotting against time the ratio of distance covered per unit of time. Since rates may change, and since such changes, too, may have rates of change, we have to deal here with a hierarchy of process profile universals at successive levels|One important sub-family of rate process profiles is illustrated by the beat or frequency profiles of cyclical processes, illustrated by the 60 beats per minute beating process of John’s heart, or the 120 beats per minute drumming process involved in one of John’s performances in a rock band, and so on. Each such process includes what we shall call a beat process profile instance as part, a subtype of rate process profile in which the salient ratio is not distance covered but rather number of beat cycles per unit of time.

But it also instantiates multiple more specialized universals at lower levels of generality, selected from   rate process profilebeat process profileregular beat process profile3 bpm beat process profile4 bpm beat process profileirregular beat process profileincreasing beat process profileand so on.In the case of a regular beat process profile, a rate can be assigned in the simplest possible fashion by dividing the number of cycles by the length of the temporal region occupied by the beating process profile as a whole.

This may not be so for entities lying at or near the boundary between the interior and exterior. This means that two objects – for example the two cells depicted in Figure 3 – may be such that there are material entities crossing their boundaries which belong determinately to neither cell. Something similar obtains in certain cases of conjoined twins (see below).|BFO 2 Reference: ‘objects’ are sometimes referred to as ‘grains’ [74|BFO 2 Reference: an object is a maximal causally unified material entity|BFO 2 Reference: To say that b is causally unified means: b is a material entity which is such that its material parts are tied together in such a way that, in environments typical for entities of the type in question,if c, a continuant part of b that is in the interior of b at t, is larger than a certain threshold size (which will be determined differently from case to case, depending on factors such as porosity of external cover) and is moved in space to be at t at a location on the exterior of the spatial region that had been occupied by b at t, then either b’s other parts will be moved in coordinated fashion or b will be damaged (be affected, for example, by breakage or tearing) in the interval between t and t.causal changes in one part of b can have consequences for other parts of b without the mediation of any entity that lies on the exterior of b. Material entities with no proper material parts would satisfy these conditions trivially. Candidate examples of types of causal unity for material entities of more complex sorts are as follows (this is not intended to be an exhaustive list):CU1: Causal unity via physical coveringHere the parts in the interior of the unified entity are combined together causally through a common membrane or other physical covering. The latter points outwards toward and may serve a protective function in relation to what lies on the exterior of the entity [13, 47|BFO 2 Reference: BFO rests on the presupposition that at multiple micro-, meso- and macroscopic scales reality exhibits certain stable, spatially separated or separable material units, combined or combinable into aggregates of various sorts (for example organisms into what are called ‘populations’). Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops. The division of portions of reality into units is one starting point for the phenomenon of counting.",,b is an object means: b is a material entity which manifests causal unity of one or other of the types CUn listed above & is of a type (a material universal) instances of which are maximal relative to this criterion of causal unity.

The attacks are especially fared because they often occur unpredictably and without warning.

Individuals with panic disorder report intense panic attacks alternating with periods of somewhat low anxiety, during which they may be apprehensive about having another panic attack. 

Some physical symptoms that the people report during the attack are: 
- breathlessness
- sweating
- choking
- nausea
- heart palpitations.

An example of a patient describing her feelings is this:

“ It happened so suddenly. Without warning I felt like I had been swept up in a tornado! … my pulse was pounding, my palms were drenched with sweat, and my throat was closing up, leaving me gasping for air. I felt paralyzed with fear, convinced I was going to die.“

Patients with dissociative amnesia have recurrent episodes in which they forget important personal information or events, usually connected with trauma or severe stress.|Is the partial or total loss of important information, sometimes occurring suddenly after stressful or traumatic event.


Understanding abnormal behavior. David Sue, Derald Wing Sue, Stanley Sue.

|The disturb person may be unable to recall information such as his or her name, address, friends, and relatives but does remember the necessities of daily life. This disorder most commonly presents as a retrospectively reported gap or series of gaps in recall for aspects of the individual's life history. These gaps are usually related to traumatic or extremely stressful events.

There are five types of memory disturbances in dissociative amnesia that vary in terms of the degree and type of memory that is lost: 
- localised amnesia.- the individual fails to recall events that occurred during a circumscribed period of time, usually the first few hours following a profoundly disturbing event. 
- selective amnesia.- the person can recall some, but not all, of the events during a circumscribed period of time.
- generalised amnesia.- failure of recall encompasses the person's entire life.
- systematised amnesia.- loss of memory for certain categories of information, such as all memories relating to one's family or to a particular person.
- continuous amnesia.- is defined as the inability to recall events subsequent to a specific time un to and including the present.

DSM-IV-TR (american Psychiatric Association)|The individual with this disorder may feel like an automaton or as if he or she is leaving in a dream or a movie. There may be a sensation of being an outside observer of one's mental processes, one's body, or parts of one's body. Various types of sensory anaesthesia, lack of affective response, and sensation of lacking control of one's actions, including speech, are often present.

Like other dissociative disorders, this one can be precipitated by physical or psychological stress. There is some evidence that emotional abuse, especially by parents, may be related to this disorder.

Various types of sensory anaesthesia, lack of affective response, and sensation of lacking control of one's actions, including speech, are often present.

Like other dissociative disorders, this one can be precipitated by physical or psychological stress. There is some evidence that emotional abuse, especially by parents, may be related to this disorder.

The symptoms of this disorder are not intentionally produced or feigned, and is not diagnosed if the symptoms or deficits are fully explained by a neurological or general medical condition, by the direct effects of a substance, or as a culturally sanctioned behaviour or experience.

A person with this disorder actually believes that there is a genuine physical problem, and it produces notable distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning.
the most common conversion symptoms seen in neurological clinics involve psychogenic pain, disturbances of stance and gait, sensory symptoms, dizziness, and psychogenic seizures.
 
The occurrence of symptoms is often related to stress. Nearly 75 percent of respondents in one sample reported that their conversion symptoms developed after they had experienced a stressor.

Some symptoms may require extensive neurological and physical examinations to rule out a true medical disorder before a diagnosis of conversion disorder can be made. Discriminating between people who are faking and those with this disorder is difficult.

                  ""Understanding abnormal behavior"". David Sue, Derald Wing Sue, Stanley Sue.

Conversion symptoms typically do not conform to known anatomical pathways and physiological mechanisms, but instead follow the individual's conceptualization of a condition. A""paralyzed"" extremity will be moved inadvertently while dressing or when attention is directed elsewhere. If placed above the head and released, a ""paralyzed"" arm will be briefly retain its position, then fall to the side, rather than striking the head.

this disorder has been reported to be more common in rural populations, individuals of lower socioeconomic status, and individuals less knowledgeable about medical and psychological concepts. As many as one-third of individuals with conversion symptoms have a current or prior neurological condition. This disorder appears to be more frequent in women than in men.

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MFOMD_0000013,depressed mood episode,,"A depressed mood episode is a pathological mental process characterised by persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, guilt, anger, isolation or hopelessness and other negative valence emotions, disturbances in sleep and appetite, fatigue, loss of interest in usually enjoyable activities and morbid or suicidal ideation.|The criteria below are based on the formal DSM-IV criteria for a Major Depressive Episode. A diagnoses of major depressive episode requires that the patient has—over a two-week period—experienced five or more of the symptoms below, and these must be outside the patient's normal behaviour. Either depressed mood or decreased interest or pleasure must be one of the five (although both are frequently concomitant).

Mood
    For the better part of nearly every day, the patient reports a depressed mood or appears depressed to others.
        The patient may state that he or she has been feeling sad, depressed, blue, empty, ""down in the dumps,"" hopeless, etc. If the patient is in denial about these feelings, yet appears to be on the verge of tearfulness, manifests a depressed facial expression and disposition, or appears to be overly irritable, these may also indicate the presence of depressed mood. Some people may report physical complaints (i.e., aches, pains, headaches) rather than depressed mood, and physical symptoms without physical cause are sometimes indicators of depression.

Anhedonia and loss of interest

    For most of nearly every day, interest or pleasure is markedly decreased in nearly all activities (noted by the patient or by others).
        People suffering with depression tend to lose interest in things they once found enjoyable. Activities are no longer enjoyable and there is often a loss of interest in or desire for sex. People who are depressed may say, ""I just don't care anymore,"" or ""nothing matters anymore."" Friends and family of the depressed person may notice that he/she has withdrawn from friends, or has neglected or quit doing activities that were once a source of enjoyment.

Change in eating, appetite, or weight

    Although not dieting, there is a marked loss or gain of weight (such as 5% in one month) or appetite is markedly decreased or increased nearly every day.
    Changes in appetite take on two manifestations: under- or over-eating.
        In the first instance, some people never feel hungry, can go long periods without wanting to eat, may forget to eat, or if they do eat a small amount of food may be sufficient. A reduction in weight is often associated with a melancholic type of depression.
        In the second instance, some people tend toward an increase in appetite and may gain significant amounts of weight. They may tend to crave certain types of food such as sweets or carbohydrates. People with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) often crave foods high in carbohydrates. Weight gain is often associated with atypical depression.

Sleep

    Nearly every day the patient sleeps excessively, known as hypersomnia, or not enough, known as insomnia.
        Insomnia is the most common type of sleep disturbance for people who are clinically depressed. Having difficulty falling asleep at night is known as ""initial"" insomnia; waking in the middle of the night and being unable to go back to sleep as ""middle insomnia"", and; waking too early as ""terminal insomnia"". Insomnia is often associated with a melancholic type of depression.
        A less frequent sleeping problem is oversleeping (called ""hypersomnia""). This may occur in the form of sleeping for prolonged periods at night or increased sleeping during the daytime. Even with excess sleep, a person may still feel tired and sluggish during the day. People with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) may sleep longer during the winter months. Hypersomnia is often associated with an atypical depression.

Motor activity

    Nearly every day others can see that the patient's activity is agitated or slow.
        People suffering from depression may be either quite agitated (psychomotor agitation), or very lethargic (psychomotor retardation) in their mannerisms and behavior. If a person is agitated, he or she may find it difficult to sit still, may pace the room, wring his/her hands, or fidget with clothes or objects. Someone with psychomotor retardation tends to move sluggishly, may move across a room very slowly, avert his/her eyes, sit slumped in a chair and speak slowly, saying little.
        In terms of diagnosis, the agitation or slowing down of one's demeanor must be to the degree that it can be observed by others.

Fatigue

    Nearly every day the person experiences extreme fatigue.[3]
        A decrease in energy and feeling fatigued are very common symptoms for those who are clinically depressed. A person may feel tired without having engaged in any physical activity, and day-to-day tasks become difficult, including getting washed and dressed in the morning. Job tasks or housework become very tiring, and the person finds that his/her work at home, school, or on the job suffers.[4]

Self-worth

    Nearly every day the patient feels worthless or inappropriately guilty. These feelings are not just about being depressed, they may be delusional.
        Depressed people may think of themselves in very negative, unrealistic ways such as manifesting a preoccupation with past ""failures"", personalisation of trivial events, or believing that minor mistakes prove their inadequacy. They also may have an unrealistic sense of personal responsibility and see things beyond their control as being their fault. Additionally, self-loathing is common in clinical depression, and can lead to a downward spiral when combined with other symptoms.

Concentration

    Noted by the patient or by others, nearly every day the patient is indecisive or has trouble thinking or concentrating.
        A person with depression frequently experiences negative and pessimistic thoughts, and reports that his/her ability to think, concentrate, or make decisions becomes impaired. Memory and distraction problems are common. This problem can be notably pronounced, causing significant difficulty in functioning for those involved in intellectually demanding activities.

Thoughts of death

    The patient has had repeated thoughts about death (other than the fear of dying), suicide (with or without a plan) or has made a suicide attempt.
        The frequency and intensity of thoughts about suicide can range from believing that friends and family would be better off if one were dead, to frequent thoughts about committing suicide (generally related to wishing to stop the emotional pain), to detailed plans about how the suicide would be carried out. Less severely suicidal people may have regular thoughts of suicide, while those who are more severely suicidal may have made specific plans and decided upon a day and location for the suicide attempt.
            Thoughts of suicide occur mostly when triggered. Thoughts of suicide happen more frequently than normal.

Diagnostic caveats

In diagnosing the symptoms a trained therapist must take the following into account:

    These symptoms must cause clinically important distress, or impair work, social or personal functioning, and they should not fulfil the criteria for Mixed Episode.
    The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., abuse of a drug or medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism).
    Other than in the case of severe symptoms (severely impaired functioning, severe preoccupation with worthlessness, ideas of suicide, delusions or hallucinations or psychomotor retardation), the episode should not have begun within two months of the loss of a loved one.

(axiom label in BFO2 Reference: [027-004])","the FMA:regional parts of an intact human body.|the Western hemisphere of the Earth|the division of the planet into hemispheres|the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body|the upper and lower lobes of the left lung|the division of the brain into regions|or with divisions drawn by cognitive subjects for practical reasons, such as the division of a cake (before slicing) into (what will become) slices (and thus member parts of an object aggregate). However, this does not mean that fiat object parts are dependent for their existence on divisions or delineations effected by cognitive subjects. If, for example, it is correct to conceive geological layers of the Earth as fiat object parts of the Earth, then even though these layers were first delineated in recent times, still existed long before such delineation and what holds of these layers (for example that the oldest layers are also the lowest layers) did not begin to hold because of our acts of delineation.Treatment of material entity in BFOExamples viewed by some as problematic cases for the trichotomy of fiat object part, object, and object aggregate include: a mussel on (and attached to) a rock, a slime mold, a pizza, a cloud, a galaxy, a railway train with engine and multiple carriages, a clonal stand of quaking aspen, a bacterial community (biofilm), a broken femur. Note that, as Aristotle already clearly recognized, such problematic cases – which lie at or near the penumbra of instances defined by the categories in question – need not invalidate these categories. The existence of grey objects does not prove that there are not objects which are black and objects which are white; the existence of mules does not prove that there are not objects which are donkeys and objects which are horses. It does, however, show that the examples in question need to be addressed carefully in order to show how they can be fitted into the proposed scheme, for example by recognizing additional subdivisions [29",,,,,(forall (x) (if (FiatObjectPart x) (and (MaterialEntity x) (forall (t) (if (existsAt x t) (exists (y) (and (Object y) (properContinuantPartOfAt x y t)))))))) // axiom label in BFO2 CLIF: [027-004] ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BFO:0000024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo.owl,fiat object part,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

|An anxiety disorder that has_symptom flashbacks, has_symptom bad dreams, has_symptom frightening thoughts, has_symptom avoidance or has_symptom hyperarousal of PTSD occurring within one month of a traumatic experience as Acute Stress Disorder or ASD.|
In this disorder, following the trauma, the traumatic event is persistently reexperienced, and the individual displays marked avoidance of stimuli that may arouse recollections of the trauma and has marked symptoms of anxiety or increased arousal. The disturbance lasts for a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of 4 weeks after the traumatic event; if symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks, the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder may be applied.

Individuals with this disorder may have a decrease in emotional responsiveness, often finding it difficult or impossible to experience pleasure in previously enjoyable activities, and frequently feel guilty about pursuing usual life tasks. 

If the trauma led to another's death or to serious injury, survivors may feel guilt about having remanded intact or about not providing enough help to others. Individuals with this disorder often perceived themselves to have greater responsibility for the consequences of the trauma than is warranted.

There is some evidence that social supports, family history, childhood experiences, personality variables, and preexisting mental disorders may influence the development of Acute Stress Disorder.

|The essential feature of Somatization disorder is a pattern of recurring, multiple, clinically significant somatic complaints. A somatic complaint is considered to be clinically significant if it results in medical treatment (e. g., the taking of medication) or causes significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Individuals with this disorder usually describe their complaints in colourful, exaggerated terms, but specific factual information is often lacking. They often seek treatment from several physicians concurrently, which may lead to complicated and sometimes hazardous combinations of treatments.  Adoption studies indicate that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the risk for this disorder; having a biological or adoptive parent with this disorder increase the risk of developing it.

Three features that suggest a diagnosis of Somatization disorder  rather than a general medical condition include:
1) Involvement of multiple organ system.
2) Early onset and chronic course without development of physical signs or structural abnormalities.
3) Absence of laboratory abnormalities that are characteristic of the suggested general medical condition.

Somatization disorder does nor protect individuals from having other independent general medical conditions. The onset of multiple physical symptoms late in life is almost always due to a general medical condition.

Vaginismus.- the essential feature of this disorder is the recurrent or persistent involuntary contraction of the perineal muscles surrounding the outer third of the vagina when vaginal penetration with penis, finger, tampon, or speculum is attempted. In some females, even the anticipation of vaginal insertion may result in muscle spam. Once the disorder is established, the course is usually chronic unless ameliorated by treatment. 

Acquired Vaginismus also may occur suddenly in response to a sexual trauma or a general medical condition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MFOMD:0000084,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,sexual pain disorder,,,,,,,"F52.6 (Dyspareunia)

http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/post-traumatic-stress-disorder|Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be summarized as a ""a normal reaction to abnormal events.""
 
Although the most important causal factor in PTSD is the traumatic event itself, individuals differ in the intensity of their cognitive and emotional responses to trauma; some persons appear to be more vulnerable than others. In some cases, this greater vulnerability is related to temperament or natural disposition, with shy or introverted people being at greater risk. In other cases, the person's vulnerability results from chronic illness, a physical disability, or previous traumatization—particularly abuse in childhood. 

Studies of specific populations have shed light on the social and cultural causes of PTSD. In general, societies that are highly authoritarian, glorify violence, or sexualize violence have high rates of PTSD even among civilians. Researchers have not found any correlation between race and biological vulnerability to PTSD.

The degree of risk for PTSD is related to three factors: 
- the amount and intensity of exposure to the suffering of trauma victims; 
- the worker's degree of empathy and sensitivity; 
- and unresolved issues from the worker's personal history.

The patient attempts to reduce the possibility of exposure to anything that might trigger memories of the trauma, and to minimize his or her reactions to such memories. This cluster of symptoms includes feeling disconnected from other people, psychic numbing, and avoidance of places, persons, or things associated with the trauma. Patients with PTSD are at increased risk of substance abuse as a form of self-medication to numb painful memories.

The patient suffers from significant social, interpersonal, or work-related problems as a result of the PTSD symptoms.

- Female orgasmic disorder (formerly inhibited Female Orgasm), in which the essential feature is a persistent or recurrent delay in, or absence of, orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase. Primary orgasmic dysfunction is considered relatively common in women: approximately 10 percent of all women have never achieved and orgasm.

- Male Orgasmic Disorder (formerly inhibited Male Orgasm), in which the essential feature is a persistent or recurrent delay in, or absence of, orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase. Some males with this disorder can reach coital orgasm but only after very prolonged and intense noncoital stimulation. Some can ejaculate only from masturbation. An even subgroup have experienced orgasm only at the moment of waking from an erotic dream.

- Premature Ejaculation, in which the essential feature is the persistent or recurrent onset of orgasm and ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it. The majority of males with this disorder can delay orgasm during self-masturbation for a considerably longer time than during coitus. The clinician must take into account factors that affect duration of the excitement phase, such as age, novelty of the sexual partner or situation, and recent frequency of sexual activity.

”Understanding abnormal behavior”. David Sue, Derald Wing Sue, Stanley Sue.|There are two types of sexual desire disorders:

- Hypoactive sexual desire disorder; where the essential feature is a deficiency or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. More frequently, the disorder develops in adulthood, after period of adequate sexual interest, in association with psychological distress, stressful life events, or interpersonal difficulties. The loss of sexual desire may be continuous or episodic, depending on psychosocial or relationship factors.

- Sexual aversion disorder; where the essential feature is the aversion to and active avoidance of genital sexual contact with a sexual partner. The individual reports anxiety, fear, or disgust when confronted by a sexual opportunity with a partner. The intensity of the individual's reaction when exposed to the aversive stimulus may range from moderate anxiety and lack of pleasure to extreme psychological distress.

The voices may speak directly to the patient, comment on their actions, or discuss the patients among themselves. Often this people try to make some sense of these hallucinations, and this can lead to the development of strange beliefs or delusions (mild symptoms can occur in healthy people and are not associated with illness).
Schizophrenia typically presents in early adulthood or late adolescence. Men have an earlier age of onset than women, and also tend to experience a more serious form of the illness with more negative symptoms, less chance of a full recovery, and a generally worse outcome. 

The greatest risk factor for schizophrenia is a positive family history, although the risks in general point to an interaction between biological, psychological, and social factors that drive increasingly deviant development and finally frank psychosis.

Stimulants like cocaine and amphetamines can induce a picture clinically identical to paranoid schizophrenia, and recent reports have also implicated cannabis.

More than 80% of patients with their first episode of psychosis will recover, although less than 20% will never have another episode. While many patients with schizophrenia have a lifelong vulnerability to recurrent episodes of illness, a large proportion will have few relapses and make a good functional recovery. An acute onset, an obvious psychosocial precipitant, and good premorbid adjustment all can improve the prognosis.

DSM-IV-TR (american Psychiatric Association)
|People with this personality disorder manifest peculiar thoughts and behaviours and have poor interpersonal relationships. Many believe they posses magical thinking abilities or special powers, and some are subject to recurrent illusions. Speech oddities, such as frequent digression or vagueness in conversation, are often present.

The evaluation of individuals must take into account their cultural milieu. The people with this disorder seem to have problems in thinking and perceiving; and often show social isolation, hypersensitivity, and inappropriate affect (emotions); they seem to lack pleasure from social interactions.

Research has demonstrated some cognitive processing abnormalities in individuals with schizotypal personality disorder that help to explain many of the symptoms, and is more prevalent among the first-degree biological relatives of individuals with Schizophrenia than the general population.

Many believe they posses magical thinking abilities or special powers, and some are subject to recurrent illusions. Speech oddities, such as frequent digression or vagueness in conversation, are often present.

The evaluation of individuals must take into account their cultural milieu. The people with this disorder seem to have problems in thinking and perceiving; and often show social isolation, hypersensitivity, and inappropriate affect (emotions); they seem to lack pleasure from social interactions.

Research has demonstrated some cognitive processing abnormalities in individuals with schizotypal personality disorder that help to explain many of the symptoms, and is more prevalent among the first-degree biological relatives of individuals with Schizophrenia than the general population.

The sexual response cycle can be divides into the following phases:
1.- Desire: This phase consist of fantasies about sexual activity and the desire to have sexual activity.
2.- Excitement: This phase consist of a subjective sense of sexual pleasure and accompanying physiological changes.
3.- Orgasm: This phase consist of a peaking of sexual pleasure, with release of sexual tension and rhythmic contraction of the perineal muscles and reproductive organs.
4.- Resolution: This phase consist of a sense of muscular relaxation and general well-being.

Disorders of sexual response may occur at one or more of this phases.

DSM-IV-TR (american Psychiatric Association)
|A phobic disorder involving the specific anxiety about being in a place or situation where escape is difficult or embarrassing or where help may be unavailable.|
The anxiety typically leads to a pervasive avoidance of a variety of situations that may include being alone outside the home or being home alone; being in a crowd of people; travelling in automobile, bus, or airplane; or being on a bridge or in an elevator.

The differential diagnosis to distinguish agoraphobia from social and specific phobia and from severe separation anxiety disorder can be difficult because all of this conditions are characterised by avoidance of specific situations.

Some of the following patterns have been found in patients with Agoraphobia.

- Some physical or psychological stressor.
- Altered physical sensation, such as increased heart rate and over-breathing.
- Faulty appraisal, such as incorrectly interpreting the symptoms as representing a severe physical problem- a heart attack or loss of control.
- Avoidance of the situation associated with the fear. the attack were described as highly aversive, and the patients' belief that they represented a pathological outcome intensified the fear. this lead to avoidance.

DSM-IV-TR (american Psychiatric Association)
|
An individual with this phobia avoids or endures these situations, which often lead to intense anxiety reactions or panic attacks. The person's fear stems foam anxiety that, when in the company of others, he or she will perform one or more activities in a way that is embarrassing or humiliating. There is no such a fear when the person engages in any of these activities in private.

People with this phobia, usually realise that their behaviour and fears are irrational, but this understanding does not reduce the distress they feel.

Social phobias can be divided into three types:

1.- Performance (excessive anxiety over activities such as playing a musical instrument, public speaking, eating in a restaurant, using public restrooms).

2.- Limited interactional (excessive fear only in specific social situations, such as going out on a date or interacting with an authority figure).

3.- Generalized (extreme anxiety displayed in most social situations; where multiple social fears were present, including fears of public speaking, using the toilet away from home, eating or drinking in public, and writing with someone watching).

""Understanding abnormal behavior"". David Sue, Derald Wing Sue, Stanley Sue.|A disease of mental health that involves a conflict between a person's actual physical gender and the gender that person identifies himself or herself as.|
There must be evidence of a strong and persistent cross-gender identification, which is the desire to be, or the insistence that one is, of the other sex. This cross-gender identification must not merely be a desire for any perceived cultural advantages of being the other sex. There must also be evidence of persistent discomfort about one's assigned sex or a sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex.

In boys, the cross-gender identification is manifested by a marked preoccupation with traditionally feminine activities. They may have preference for dressing in girls'or women's clothes or may improvise such items from available materials when genuine articles are unavailable. There is a strong attraction for the stereotypical games and pastimes of girls. They avoid rough-and-tumble play and competitive sports and have a little interest in cars and trucks or other nonaggressive but stereotypical boys'toys. They may express a wish to be a girl and assert that they will grow up to be a woman. They may insist on sitting to urinate and pretend not to have a penis by pushing it in between their legs.

Girls with Gender Identity Disorder display intense negative reactions to parental expectations or attempts to have them wear dresses or other feminine attire. They prefer boys' clothing and short hair, are often misidentified by strangers as boys, and may ask to be called by boy's name. These girls prefer boys as play-mates, with whom they share interests in contact sports, rough-and-tumble play, and traditional boyhood games. A girl with tis disorder may occasionally refuse to urinate in a sitting position. She may claim that she has or will grow a penis and may not want to grow breasts or to menstruate. She may assert that she will grow up to be a man.

Adults whit this disorder are preoccupied with their wish to live as a member of the other sex. This preoccupation may be manifested as an intense desire to adopt the social role of the other sex or to acquire the physical appearance of the other sex through hormonal or surgical manipulation. To varying degrees, they adopt the behaviour, dress, and mannerisms of the other sex. Whit cross-dressing and hormonal treatment (and for males, electrolysis), many individuals with this disorder may pass convincingly as the other sex.

In Adolescents, the clinical features may resemble either those of children or those of adults, depending on the individual's developmental level, and the criteria should be applied accordingly.

Classic hallmarks of addiction include: impaired control over substances/behavior, preoccupation with substance/behavior, continued use despite consequences, and denial. Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification (short-term reward), coupled with delayed deleterious effects (long-term costs). Physiological dependence occurs when the body has to adjust to the substance by incorporating the substance into its 'normal' functioning. This state creates the conditions of tolerance and withdrawal. Tolerance is the process by which the body continually adapts to the substance and requires increasingly larger amounts to achieve the original effects. Withdrawal refers to physical and psychological symptoms people experience when reducing or discontinuing a substance the body had become dependent on. Symptoms of withdrawal generally include but are not limited to anxiety, irritability, intense cravings for the substance, nausea, hallucinations, headaches, cold sweats, and tremors.
